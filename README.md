# Tip Analysis App

To work in this app you need to have a ready-made CSV file. 

For the application to work correctly, make sure that your dataframe contains the following columns:
- total bill amount ('total_bill')
- tip for the corresponding bill ('tip')
- sex data ('sex') in Female / Male format
- smoker/non-smoker data ('smoker') in Yes / No format
- day of the week data ('day')
- meal time ('time') in Dinner / Lunch format
- order quantity data ('size')

Enjoy!
